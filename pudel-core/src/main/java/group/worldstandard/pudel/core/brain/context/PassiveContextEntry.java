 * Represents a single passive context entry collected from a Discord message.

 * Passive context is gathered when Pudel observes messages it doesn't directly
 * respond to, building understanding of ongoing conversations.
 * <p>
 * Entities are extracted from the message and can include:
 * - Users mentioned (@user)
 * - Channels referenced (#channel)
 * - Emojis used (:emoji:)
 * - Roles mentioned (@role)
 * - Attachment URLs (Discord CDN links)
 * - Reply references (message_id of the replied-to message)
 * - Forwarded message references
 *
 * @param messageId   the Discord message ID this context came from
 * @param userId      the user who sent the message
 * @param channelId   the channel the message was sent in
 * @param content     the raw message content
 * @param entities    extracted entities (users, channels, emojis, roles, etc.)
 * @param attachmentUrls Discord CDN URLs for attachments (images, videos, etc.)
 * @param replyToMessageId the message ID this message replies to (if any)
 * @param forwardedMessages list of forwarded message data (if any)
 * @param timestamp   when the context was collected
