## 4. Data Storage and Isolation

### 4.1 Per-Guild Schemas

We implement strong data isolation:

```
PostgreSQL Database
├── public (shared metadata)
├── guild_<id_1> (Guild 1 data)
│   ├── dialogue_history
│   ├── memory_embeddings
│   └── user_preferences
├── guild_<id_2> (Guild 2 data)
│   └── ...
└── user_<id> (DM data)
    └── ...
```

- Each guild has its own database schema
- Guild data is never shared with other guilds
- User DM data is stored in separate schemas
- Database credentials are isolated per schema

### 4.2 Memory and Conversation Data

| Subscription Tier | User Memory Limit | Guild Memory Limit |
|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Free | 1,000 rows | 5,000 rows |
| Tier 1 | 1,500 rows | 7,500 rows |
| Tier 2 | 2,000 rows | 10,000 rows |
| Unlimited | No limit | No limit |

- Older data is automatically pruned when limits are reached
- Memory embeddings are stored using pgvector with IVFFlat indexing
- Conversation context is used for AI responses within the same guild

### 4.3 Data Location

- **Official Instance**: Data is stored on servers operated by the official instance operator
- **Self-Hosted**: Data is stored wherever you choose to host

---

## 5. Data Sharing

### 5.1 We Do NOT Sell Your Data

We never sell, rent, or trade your personal information to third parties for marketing purposes.

### 5.2 Limited Sharing

We may share information only in these cases:

| **Legal Authorities** | As required | Legal compliance |

### 5.3 Plugin Data Access

Plugin developers are bound by their own privacy policies. Review plugin privacy practices before installation.
