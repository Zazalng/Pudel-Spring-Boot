 * Interface for DAVE (Discord Audio/Voice Encryption) protocol implementation.
 *
 * <p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> Starting March 1st, 2026, Discord requires all voice connections
 * to use End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) via the DAVE protocol. Plugins that want to
 * use voice functionality MUST provide a DAVE implementation.</p>
 *
 * <p>Available implementations include:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><a href="https://github.com/MinnDevelopment/jdave">JDAVE</a> - Requires Java 25+</li>
 *   <li><a href="https://github.com/KyokoBot/libdave-jvm">libdave-jvm</a> - Requires Java 8+</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Plugin developers are responsible for choosing and bundling their DAVE implementation.</p>
 *
 * @see <a href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/voice-connections#dave-protocol">Discord DAVE Protocol Documentation</a>
